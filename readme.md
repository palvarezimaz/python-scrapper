# A Python WEB Scrapper

To gain familiarity with the language, and to gain some experience, I'll try to code a Web scrapper with Python that, hopefully, will aid in the job-hunt.

## Background

I've used GUI based crawlers along my professional life to quickly gain data, but I've never actually used a scrapper, so I'm thrilled to implement that technology. I will be using BeautifulSoup for it.

On the other hand, I've used Ruby, but just touched Python, so what best than putting a language into practice to gain familiarity with it.

I'll probably use Django as a framework.

This is a side project in **very** early stages, so stay tuned for updates!
